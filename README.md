# webjam-base-template

This is the template repository for ICSSC's WebJam 2024 workshop.

## Developing with CodeSandbox

After you've used this template to create a copy in your account, sign in to [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io) with your GitHub account. When asked to choose a plan, just choose the free plan.

Once you've successfully created a CodeSandbox account, import your repository by clicking the "+ Repository" button on the top bar of the website, close to the top-right corner. When prompted to authorize GitHub, click on "Authorize access to public and private repositories" and follow the steps.

Select the repository you created and click "Import repository" in the bottom right of the popup window; no need to change any of the settings. It'll take a while for CodeSandbox to import your repository, but once that's done you'll need to set up your project in the right-hand panel.

Make sure "Use the current configuration" is selected, click "next" all the way until the final page, and then click "Apply and start". It may fail the first time, so if that happens just click the plus in a box on the right hand side, click "Project setup" again, and just repeat the steps.
